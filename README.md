This very basic React app is part of my Udemy course [React Basics for Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-basics-for-developers/?referralCode=4D7B68443467018C5ED7) and is later used as a placeholder Portfolio Piece in my soon-to-be-published course "Create a Portfolio App with React 18 and React Router 6 (with React hooks, custom-made hook, Context API)".

From the "React Basics for Developers" course description on Udemy:

> React is the most widely used front end development technology in 2022, and for good reason.
> 
> In this course, we take a hands-on approach to exploring React at a foundational level through three key concepts: React is declarative, React is component-based, React is composable. 
> 
> We use React 18 and create-react-app to create three small apps.
> 
> Plain language is used to relate abstract concepts such as components, composability, and state to real world examples.
> 
> Some of the things we will do are:
> 
>   * Run create-react-app in the terminal to generate our boilerplate App
> 
>   * Write function components from scratch to create three small React Apps
> 
>   * Explore React State both conceptually and practically
> 
>   * Explore the State Object and see how the useState() hook manages the State Object for us
> 
>   * Manage State in our App with the useState()Â hook
> 
>   * Discuss ways to improve scalability and performance in our App
> 
>   * Nest components and pass props
> 
> At the end of this course, you can expect to have a solid foundation of React understanding that you can build on in whatever direction you like: whether you are interested in becoming a React specialist, whether you're just looking to add another tool to your Developer tool belt, or whether you simply wish to gain an understanding of React at a foundational level.
